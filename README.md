Developed a computer vision-based control system using OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements in real-time. The system calculates the angle between the hand and the horizontal axis from a live camera feed and translates this input to control a servo motorâ€™s movement. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision, machine learning, and embedded systems for intuitive, gesture-based control.
